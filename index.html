        <p>Step One: Get the sttering wheel angle.
            <br>
            With your front tire facing straight ahead as if you were driving going straight down the road.
            Turn your handlebars all the way to the left or right until they hit the steering stops. Measure this angle.
            Most motorcycles should be between 40-50&deg;.
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>Step Two: Get your wheelbase measurement in inches
            <br>Draw a straight line from your axles to the ground and measure this distance between these two points,
            in inches.
            Note, changing the height in yor triple clamps can change the wheelbase and your steering angle, therefore
            it will effect your turning radius

            <br id="finalText"> This Calculator is able to account for lean angle upto 45&deg;s with handlebars at full
            lock. Most
            trials motorcycles can lean this far however, one is unlikely to lean an enduro bike or street bike further
            than 60&deg; with a full lock turn
